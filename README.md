I have a strong foundation in **Python-based backend development**, particularly using **FastAPI**, and practical experience developing modern web applications using **React and Next.js**.  
I have contributed to multiple **academic, internship, and personal projects**, working both independently and in collaborative environments.

I am currently seeking **full stack development internship opportunities** where I can apply my skills to real-world systems and continue strengthening my engineering expertise.
